## Script Run

In addition to the graphical start-up method based on VeighNa Station, you can also create run.py in any directory and write the following sample code.

```Python
from vnpy.event import EventEngine
from vnpy.trader.engine import MainEngine
from vnpy.trader.ui import MainWindow, create_qapp
from vnpy_ctp import CtpGateway
from vnpy_ctastrategy import CtaStrategyApp
from vnpy_ctabacktester import CtaBacktesterApp

def main():
    qapp = create_qapp()

    event_engine = EventEngine()
    main_engine = MainEngine(event_engine)
    
    main_engine.add_gateway(CtpGateway)
    main_engine.add_app(CtaStrategyApp)
    main_engine.add_app(CtaBacktesterApp)

    main_window = MainWindow(main_engine, event_engine)
    main_window.showMaximized()

    qapp.exec()

if __name__ == "__main__"。
    main()
```

Open CMD in that directory (hold Shift->click right mouse button->open command window/PowerShell here) and then run the following command to start VeighNa Trader.
